# TURF

**TURF works in the background of your life while you earn rewards.**  
Join the decentralized web revolution today.

---

## 🌍 Overview

TURF is a passive participation layer for the decentralized internet.  
It operates silently behind your everyday digital activity and transforms contribution into value.

No complicated workflows.  
No constant input.  
Just connect — and let the protocol run.

---

## ✨ Core Principles

- Participation should be effortless  
- Contribution should be measurable  
- Rewards should be automatic  
- Ownership should belong to users  

---

## ⚡ How It Works

1. Connect your wallet or identity.
2. TURF runs quietly in the background.
3. Network activity is validated.
4. Rewards are distributed back to participants.

Simple. Invisible. Continuous.
